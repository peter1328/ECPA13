TITLE: Statistical and Theoretical Reductionism in Research on Scientific Thinking: How much theory can Rasch Models reveal?

In recent research on scientific thinking, Rasch modeling was employed to investigate the dimensionality of items that were meant to cover a wide variety of skills.

Based on generic fit statistics and model comparisons, it was concluded that scientific thinking represents a unidimensional construct.

We argue that generic fit statistics and model comparisons merely warrant crude conclusions about the use of composite scores for practical assessments.

However, they do not warrant theoretical conclusions about the dimensionality of the underlying psychological construct.

Crucial assumptions of the Rasch model and their implications for theory development are discussed, expanding the discussion by drawing parallels to reductionism in intelligence and psychiatry research. From this discussion we conclude that an undue reliance on Rasch models might be hindering and perhaps deteriorating for theory development in research on scientific thinking.

Alternative model tests and measurement models are discussed that might provide more thorough insight into the structure of scientific thinking.

This discussion is underpinned by a simulation study comparing the adequacy of various measurement models to examine structural assumptions about scientific thinking.

Based on the results of the simulation study, we conclude that alternative measurement models and intervention studies might be the preferred methods to shed further light on the interrelations of scientific thinking.
